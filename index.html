    <li> Drowsiness Detection System </li>
    <p> This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents.A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy. Code is in Python (version 2.7 or higher will work). Algorithm:-- Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye . condition-- It checks 20 consecutive frames and if the Eye Aspect ratio is lesst than 0.25, Alert is generated </p>

    <p> With the help of sensors and other components we have made a
prototype of a car parking which is itself smart in many ways. It can tell

spaces and the occupied spaces and the information about these can be
